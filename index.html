            <hr>
            <img class="small-pad" src = "assets/images/Hey.jpg" alt = "cat man">
            <p class = "left info-chunk">I am currently 18 years old, and I was born on July 11th, 2000. I have a family of six people that consists of two brothers, a sister,
                and my mother and father. Both my brothers are older than me, the second oldest brother attends Kettering University for engineering and the other 
                owns a mechanic business with his friends.
            </p>

            <p Class = "left info-chunk">Coding has been one of my hobbies since middleschool since I never used to be funny back then I just stayed home and studied and coded
                on my computer. In highschool I took all of the classes that included coding including AP Java and even tried out my school's tech internship
                they were implementing for students that were interested in such a career path. The internship just required to develop an application that you thought
                would be useful to the school.
            </p>

            <p class = "left info-chunk">I have studied many languages by myself, such as c++, c+, java before I took the class, lua, python, and a couple more outside of classes.
                Coding is one of the only things that sparks my interests and can keep my attention for more than a minute, in fact it can keep my attention for hours
                at a time, which comes in very handy for writing big chunks of applications and programs.
